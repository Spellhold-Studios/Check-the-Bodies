CtB_FF v1.0
This mod allows you to bypass all the chores and lectures during the inital part of the Check the Bodies mod (By CBisson) while still retaining the options for the various abilities that you had the opportunity to learn. When you speak to Gorion after first appearing in Candlekeep, just ask him to "skip" the lectures and chores. It should work at almost any point along the days of chores, so long as they are not done for the day. The rest should be pretty straightfoward. I left in CBisson's rebuilt cutscenes from BG1 as I respect the work he did for the mod, as well as it's just a cool series of flashbacks. I hope this will help others enjoy the mod without having to endure the labors of childhood in a cRPG.
