Check the Bodies adds various quests to the BGII part of the game, including new areas, a new city, spells, stores, animations, and items:
This is a mini-quest mod, each single quest works as a stand alone quest. That is to say, if one were to start a new game, play one of my new quests, and finish the game, there should be no problems. Each quest is heavily dependant on a number of random factors:  the PC's race, class, alignment, etc., chapter, make up of the party, and so many other factors. It will be impossible for a single character to play through the entire game and get *all* of Check The Bodies' quests. That is by design. Don't worry, no matter what you choose for a character, you won't miss anything for that character.
For a list of the quests, see "CtB_Quest_List.txt".

The second component contains the Candlekeep Chores which will start in the library of Irenicus' Dungeon:
This component adds the so called "Candlekeep Chores" which will trigger inside the library of Irenicus' Dungeon. The PC will be back in Candlekeep, remembering his/her chores during his normal life in Candlekeep. These chores have to be executed in length if the component "Candlekeep Chores Fast Foreward" is not installed. Each finished chore will grant the PC an ability.

The third component is called "Candlekeep Chores Fast Foreward" and gives the possibility to shorten the Candlekeep Chores, by hlid:
This component allows you to bypass all the chores and lectures during the inital part of the Check the Bodies mod (By CBisson) while still retaining the options for the various abilities that you had the opportunity to learn. When you speak to Gorion after first appearing in Candlekeep, just ask him to "skip" the lectures and chores. It should work at almost any point along the days of chores, so long as they are not done for the day. The rest should be pretty straightfoward. I left in CBisson's rebuilt cutscenes from BG1 as I respect the work he did for the mod, as well as it's just a cool series of flashbacks. I hope this will help others enjoy the mod without having to endure the labors of childhood in a cRPG. 

The forth component ("Other Improvements") patches the main component with some improvements:
-Entrances of AR0404.are are to the original position
-Change Yusef's name to Yassir, because Yusef is Surayas brother
-Start the pirate quest in Athkathla at the gates by level 10

Tools:
  I couldn't have built the files without NearInfinity. What a lovely tool! (I once told Jon I was going to name the mod after him, obviously I lied, but thanks anyway Jon!)
  Also, IETME, great work Theo!
  Weidu as a simple and fast dialog creator- which for me makes altering/adding to dialogs SOOOO very simple.
  TISunpack and ogg decoders which made the mod quite smaller for downloading.
  I used DLTCEP a bit towards the end of the creation process, so hats off to Avenger.
  The 'old standby' IEEP, still useful and Todd is owed so much by the IE modding community for his work that nearly started the whole thing.
  ...and other IE tools: InfExpl, IDU, MOS/BAM Workshops, et all.

Weidu Installation Assistance provided by JCompton and Wes Weimer. Thanks guys!
Weidu Bug Testing provided by Andrew. Thanks!
Additional material taken from IE Games: BGI, IWDI, IWDII.

Thanks to testers, supporters, etc. You know who you are, but there are waaaaay to many to list.

I'm sure I forgot other people, so PLEASE! If you helped me in any way with Check The Bodies, please! please! Write me and remind me!

And I can't forget to say thanks the fantastic crew at BioWare/Interplay for these games. Words can't say how happy I am they did a lot of 'planning' to make the Infinity Engine truly infinite.
